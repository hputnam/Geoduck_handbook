## <span style="color:green">**I.1. The hatchery**</span>

#### Hatchery

Sustainable shellfish industry is fueled by success at the hatchery stage. The critical hatchery stages for geoduck production last nearly 7-8 months from November to May/June to conditoon and spawn adult broodstock and rear larvae to juvenile 'seed'. Early-life stages from embryos to early juveniles are highly succeptible to envrionmental conditions and disease. Thus, the overarching goal of technicians is to ensure optimal conditions for growth and survival to maximize production of 'seed' of a size ranging ~4 - 7 mm shell length. This 'seed' stage is ideal for growers when geoduck are actively burrowing and able to cope with the planting process during grow-out (*discussed in 'Grow-out' below*).

> *SKILLS AT THE HATCHERY*: At any snapshot in time, a hatchery is pumping massive amounts of seawater inflow and sutaining billions of live algae cells and shellfish at various life stages. Reguardless of the production scale, hatchery maintanance demands versitile training and skills in animal husbandry and microalgae culture -- they can also benefit greatly from some ingenuity! (i.e. on-the-spot carpentry and plumbing).

#### <span style="color:black">**Geoduck aquaculture requires  the following...**</span>
#### <span style="color:gray">**Algae, algae... and more algae**</span>
  - <span style="color:gray">**Greenhouse(s) and algae room(s)**</span>: live algae feed is pivotal in hatchery maintanance and production success. Daily, technicians clean, culture, and feed-out both large-low and small-dense batch cultures. Typical algae concentrations (cells per milliliter, c-1 ml-1) of the batch cultures range from 50,000 c-1 ml-1 (large-low density) to 1-2 milllion c-1 ml-1 (small-high density). A few important species common to Pacific geoduck aquaculture are *Isocrysis*, *Pavlova*, *Tetraselmis*, and *Chaetoceros*. Feed composition and species density is life-stage dependent for optimal geoduck growth and survivial.

#### <span style="color:gray">**Table: Feed and geoduck life stages**</span>

  Life-stage | Age  | Density (c-1 ml-1)  | Composition (algae species)
--------   | -----| ----  | ---
Fetilized eggs / embryo   | 0-0.5 days | NA | NA
Trochophore  |  < 1-2 days | NA | NA

#### <span style="color:gray">**Tank Systems**</span>

  - <span style="color:gray">**Stage-depedent systems of tanks**</span>: metamorphic transitions of molluscs from embryo-juvenile stages present a series of challenges. Shellfish aquaculture is mindful of critical developmental transitions that require alterntive systems for survival. For example, 'settlement' is the postlarval stage when geoduck transition from free-swimming larvae to an increasingly sessile (not swimming) stage. The planning and timuing of this stage is essential at the hatchery because 'settled' animals will adhere to the sides of the tank and begin crawling. Therefore, the whole system must transition entirely from upwelling conical tanks (commonly used for free-swmming stags) to downwelling or setting systems with sediment to allow anmals to burrow (downwellers, setting tables, heath stacks).

#### <span style="color:gray">**Table: Common hatchery systems for each life stage**</span>

  Life-stage | Age  | Tank type  | Common size(s) (L) | Flow-though (Y/N) | Notes
--------   | -----| ----  | --- | --- | ---
Fetilized eggs / embryo   | 0-0.5 days   | larval rearing tank | 5,000 | N | remain static, filters: 20µm banjo filter as fail-safe
Trochophore  |  < 1-2 days | larval rearing tank or conical tank | 250 - 5,000 | N | filters: 20µm banjo filter, light circulation with air/bubbling
D-hinge & Umbone 'mature' larvae / Prodissoconch I & II  | 2-16 days | upwelling conical tank   | 250 - 750 | Y | filters: increase size as larvae grow, avoid clogging from algae leading to overflow and loss of larvae
Pediveliger / Dissoconch   | 16 - 35 days | setting table, heathstack, downwellers | 15 - 30 L (tray and tank inserts)  | Y  | high seawater flow; sand added; animal density per tank or tray dependent on surface area; start with 180µm lining and increase as animals grow
Juvenile  |  36 days - 5 to 7 months (preceeding grow-out) | 15 - 30 L (tray and tank inserts)  |setting table, heathstack | Y | high seawater flow; sand added; animal density per tank or tray dependent on surface area; large sturdy mesh/lining for 3mm shell sizeminimum
Broodstock (spawning)  |  4-6 years (minimum) | large rectangular tanks | 200+ | Y | high seawater flow, no filters needed

## <span style="color:green">**I.2. Broodstock Conditioning & Natural Spawning**</span>

#### Broodstock collection and conditioning:
Broodstock are adult animals either grown or wild caught for spawning in the hatchery. Large-scale hatcheries with the space and resources often collect numerous broodstock from multiple regions to maintain genetic diversity and 'hedge their bets' for spawning.

Pacific geoduck reproduce sexually and are broadcast spawners, meaning males and females release gametes in the water column and rely on the simultaneous release from both sexes for fertilization in open water. In aquaculture, wild or grown broodstock are collected as early as late-Fall and brought to the hatchery. 'Broodstock conditioning' is the process by which hatchery technicians prepare adults for spawning to increase reproductive success and offsrping survival. The timing for 'broodstock conditioning' targets the vital period of 'gametogenesis' or the period during which gametes, especially eggs, are developing and multiplying in adults. A rich diet of algae loaded with essential fats does the trick - it is common to feed broodstock for a few months over gametogenesis before the first attempt at spawning. In addition, a growing field of research suggests that stress from the envrionment can also affect spawning, reproduction, and offsrping survival! (*some resources on this below*)

#### How to Induce Natural Spawning:

- **dramaitic increase in diet**: Spikes of algal density can provide the spark technicians need to elicit a planned spawning event. A few gallons of dense batch culture are simply added to broodstock tanks.
- **simulate tidal cycles / handling stress**: Another method is a short-term exposure out of water. Tanks are rapidly and completely drained. An added benefit of this technique is that broodstock can be removed from the tanks entirely. this permits technicians to wash the tank of faeces and algae biolfilms to ensure optimal conditions for spawning and gamete quality when released. It must be noted that this process is stressful for broodstock and may induce lethal harm if repeated in quick succession or prolonged for extended periods of time.  In combination with diet, high algae culture can be added with the seawater upon re-filling to trigger spawning.
- **add gametes**: An artifact of natural spawning is the common scenario of non-simultaneous release of gametes from both males and females. If either sex has released gametes, a sample of this seawater rich in egg or sperm cells can be added to a broodstock tank to trigger reproductive cues from the opposing sex.

## <span style="color:green">**I.4 Grow-out**</span>
Hatchery producers work alongside growers to sell  seed for 'grow-out'. 'Grow-out' is the process of planting goeduck on the beach. Once burrowed, geoduck are increasingly sessile, meaning that an individual will borrow deeper at it grows but remain in the same burrow for the rest of its life. The process is fairly simple, three seed are planted on each poitn within a covered PVC or mesh lining to prevent predation for the first year. Once one year in age, it is assumed that survivors are burrowed sufficiently deep in the sediment to remove these barriers and remain untouched for several years until market size (4-7 years!). The commercial value of adult geoduck is primarily driven by consumers and international trade. Large-scale industries  often have the infrastructure and land to both rear and grow their own seed emcompassing all aspects of production, however autotomous growers are also common in the Pacific Northwwest and solely purchase seed from local hatcheries to grow on private land.



#### <span style="color:gray">**Table: Timeline of geoduck production**</span>

Production stage | Setting  | Timeline
---   | -----| ----
Spawning & Broodstock conditiong  | Hatchery  | 2-4 months
Fertilization-juvenile |  Hatchery  |  0 to 5-7 months
Grow-out  |  Beaches/mudflats  | 4-7 years

  > *FOOD FOR THOUGHT*: The table and cartoon above demonstrate the timing and significance of the hatchery relative to the grow-out period. As one can see, the hatchery presents a short window (5-7 months) relative to the entire life history of geoduck (up to 168 years) and the market timeline (up tp 7 years).

## <span style="color:Green">**II.1 Identification of Sex & Reproductive Status**</span>

A major artifact of geoduck aquaculture is the **spontaneous and opportunistic nature of natural spawning events**. For example, an unplanned nighttime natural spawn of a female geoduck set the stage for the growing season at Jamestown Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery in winter 2019 (*Mat Henderson, personal communication*). Millions of eggs (~30) were released into a single broodstock tank with two dozen other animals (of unknown sex) and under seawater flow-though. In an optimal scenario, technicians would have isolated the spawning female to a static tank to control spawning/fertilization and maximize  egg yield. This event lead to a totally autotomous fertilization process outside of standard 9:00am - 5:00pm work hours. In most cases, spontaneous and unplanned spawning presents major loss in potential profit - luckily, personnel at JPWSH live on site and were able to salvage fertilized embryos.

Losses in production and profit are unfortunately common in shellfish aquaculture. In the story stated above, aquaculture technicians were limited by two main factors:
- **sex identification of broodstock**: The sex is unknown to hatchery personnel and is only revelead once an individual begins spawning.
- **reproductive status of broodstock**: Wild broodstock are typically collected in early winter and are fed algae-rich diets at the hatchery for several weeks/months to assume an optimal reproductive state. However, the timing to start controlled spawning attempts remains poorly understood.

#### We deployed new techniques to track adult geoduck

Trait  | Importance in Aquaculture | Technique | Note
------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ----|
**Sex of broodstock groups** | avoid spontaneous spawning and fertilization; enhance control of spawning attempts | **gonad biopsy** | invasive sub-lethal
|  |   |   |
**Reproductive status** | determine optimal timining for spawning; identify individuals to focus spawning efforts; control and increase diversity| **hemolymph extraction (vitellogenin)**, **gonad biopsy** | minimially invasive; invasive sub-lethal

## <span style="color:Green">**II.2. Strip Spawning**</span>

#### About:
Strip spawning is a destructive method for spawning geoduck, meaning all chosen animals are dissected and sacraficed. Therefore, is it ideal to both identify the reproductive status and sex during broodstock conditioning (i.e. gonad biopsy and/or hemolymph extraction) and tag animals . As opposed to natural spawning, strip spawning allows hatcheries to plan time and effort fertilization and larval rearing.

#### Steps:

  1. Identify sex and reproductive status of broodstock. Are animals far along and prepared to spawn? Observed eggs and aperm with microscopy. Activate sperm with seawater and cells with be  mobile and easier to see!
  2. Prepare working space for strip spawning. This includes table space, access to 0.2µm filtered seawater, 20µm seives (2-3), seawater table/large tray, access to compound microscope with slides, pipettes, and beakers.
  3. Remove chosen males and females from the broodstock tank
  4. Dissect broodstock tissue along the shells with a curved spatuala and remove the gonad
  5. With a clean scalpel blade, cut shallow striations/hashes along the entire gonad. Work slowly over a rinsed beaker. Gamete cells will start to secrete from the tissue and drip. You can also use the blunt side of the scalpel to sweep the striations to increase the secreted gametes.
  6. If strip spawning a female goand, use 0.2µm-filtered seawater in a squirt bottle as you strip spawn. Eggs must be in seawater to ensure viability donstream in this process. In contrast, DO NOT use seawater while strip spawning male gonads. This will activate the sperm and leave them unviable when needed for fertilization. Strip spawn the male gonad without seawater into a dry beaker and leave fridgerated at 12-14C until eggs are prepared for fertilization.

  NOTE: all individuls strip spawned have thier own individual beaker - do not mix gametes

  7. After a feamle gonad is deplete, add seawater to teh beaker of eggs to hydrate them. Hydrated eggs are nearly perfect circles whereas eggs without seawater will appear elongated.
  8. Once hydrated, eggs are ready for activation. Add KCl to egg batches to target a concentration of 0.1 M KCl, mix gently, and let sit for 15-20 minutes.
  9. Rinse egg batches (seperately per individual!) on a 20 µm seive with filtered seawater. The objective of this step is to remove the KCl and prepare eggs for sperm. Rinse eggs off the 20 µm seive into a beaker with 0.2 181m filtered seawater.
  10. Activate sperm and fertilize eggs with small aliquots of sperm. Use microscopy to check the eggs after sperm is added. Polyspermy must be avoided and occurs when eggs are overencumbered by sperm leading to low fertilization rate. An optimal range is ~10-30 sperm around each egg.

  NOTE: remember to cross all males with all females to increase diversity!


#### Photos:

  - Photos below show unhydrated eggs from the strip spawn. Notive that eggs appear elongated and are aggregated.

<img src="Geoduck_aquaculture.assets/eggs_1.JPG" width="275"> <img src="Geoduck_aquaculture.assets/eggs_3_noprime.JPG" width="275">

  - Photo below shows strip-spawned eggs both hydrated and activated with KCl. These 'primed' eggs are nearly perfect circles due to hydration and appear evently seperated relative to the 'inactivated' eggs in prior photos (above).
  - Eggs are now prepared for fertlization of activated sperm. Sperm is activated rapidly by adding seawater. It must be noted that sperm viability is best after initial activation. To increase successful fertilization, sperm should be activated immediately prior to being added to batches of eggs. Gonad biopsies for sex identification are critical to plan strip spawning of females and males.
